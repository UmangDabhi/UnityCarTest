# UnityCarTest
This is a car and track model, the Track is created by Unity Terrain and the track look is given as it is near to mountains and some obstacle type path is also there, the car is created by me using basic shapes, could take the car assets from online but that would have been easy, so created a simple car assets using basic elements, representating that i do have knowledge of how elements are attached to each other and their movement and rotation relation.
